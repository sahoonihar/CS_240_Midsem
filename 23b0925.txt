As we can see from the code clearly h_inferior with h_superior as h_s > h_i so h_i in inferior to h_s because h_s accounts for rows as well but h_inf only uses free diagonals
 
But comparing nodes expanded we can see that h_inf and h_sup  give the same performance but h_inf is better compared to h_empty
 
As h_sup is monotonic clearly h_inf is also monotonic
